            <h1>APRIL 2052</h1>
            <p>The Resource Wars began. Many smaller nations went bankrupt, and Europe, dependent on oil imports from the Middle East, responded to the Middle East's rising oil prices with military action. The long drawn-out war between the European Commonwealth
              and the Middle East had begun.</p>

            <h1>FEBUARY 2059</h1>
            <p>The Anchorage Front Line was established, as the United States increased its military presence in Alaska to protect its oil interests. The Anchorage Front Line raised tensions in the United States and Canada, as the United States attempted
              to pressure Canada into allowing American military units to guard the Alaskan Pipeline.</p>

            <h1>JUNE 2060</h1>
            <p>The Euro-Middle Eastern War came to an end as the oil fields in the Middle East ran dry. There was no longer a goal in the conflict, and both sides were reduced almost to ruin. The European Commonwealth dissolved into quarreling nation states,
              fighting over the remaining resources.</p>

            <h1>DECEMBER 2066</h1>
            <p>In the winter of 2066, China invaded Alaska. The Anchorage Front Line became a true battleground. As a sign of increasing tension between the two countries, Canada proved reluctant to allow American troops on Canadian soil or allow American
              planes to fly over Canadian airspace. The tensions between the United States and Canada rose, but Canada eventually backed down, and US troops passed through Canada. This set the stage for the Canadian annexation in 2076.</p>

            <h1>JANUARY 2067</h1>
            <p>The first suit of T-45d power armor was deployed in Alaska. While lacking the full mobility of future versions, its sheer power was incredibly effective against Chinese infantry. Its ability to carry heavy ordnance became key in various localized
              conflicts, and it had the power to destroy entire towns without endangering the wearer. China rushed to create its own versions, but they were many years behind the United States.</p>

            <h1>SEPTEMBER 2072</h1>
            <p>The United States' increasing demand for Canadian resources caused protests and riots in several Canadian cities. An attempted sabotage of the Alaskan pipeline was all the military needed as an excuse to begin its annexation of Canada.</p>

            <h1>OCTOBER 2074</h1>
            <p>Negotiations between the US and other world powers come to a dramatic end, with the President walking out of oil talks with the other world powers. After a much heated debate, the President stormed out of the meeting and declared that the
              last known supply of petroleum in the world would be used exclusively by the US and the US would not sell or trade any oil to outside parties.</p>

            <h1>JANUARY 2076</h1>
            <p>The United States annexation of Canada was complete. Canadian protesters and rioters were shot on sight, and the Alaskan Pipeline swarmed with American military units. Pictures of atrocities made their way to the United States, causing further
              unrest and protests.</p>

            <h1>JUNE 2076</h1>
            <p>T-51b power armor was invented. This was the pinnacle of power armor technology before the Great War. Many of these units were sent to China, and they began to carve a swath through the Chinese forces. The Chinese resources were strained to
              the breaking point, and the supply lines from the nations China has annexed begin to break down.</p>

            <h1>OCTORBER 2077</h1>
            <p>The Great War began and ended, and to the present day it is unknown who fired the first weapon. Air raid sirens sounded, but very few people went into the Vaults, thinking it was a false alarm. The Vaults were sealed and the world was plunged
              into nuclear winter.</p>
